## Customizing the Chart Appearance
The appearance of the WPF FastLine chart can be customized by following chart features

**Personalized Titles**
The [Header](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Charts.ChartBase.html#Syncfusion_UI_Xaml_Charts_ChartBase_Header) property is employed to define the chart's title, improving the understanding of the displayed data. Additionally, Header can be positioned left or right side of the chart using [HorizontalHeaderAlignment](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Charts.ChartBase.html#Syncfusion_UI_Xaml_Charts_ChartBase_HorizontalHeaderAlignment) property.

**Axis Customization**
We can customize axis elements, including the axis range, axis label format, grid lines, major tickline style, change the axis's positioning, and disable axis visibility.

**Series Customization**
The fill colors of FastLine series can be customized using [Interior](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Charts.ChartSeriesBase.html#Syncfusion_UI_Xaml_Charts_ChartSeriesBase_Interior) property

## Interactive Features
[Trackball](https://help.syncfusion.com/wpf/charts/interactive-features/trackball), which allows you to track a data point closer to the cursor. We can enable trackball in both series and axis. Additionally, you can customize the trackball using the [TrackBallLabelTemplate](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Charts.ChartSeriesBase.html#Syncfusion_UI_Xaml_Charts_ChartSeriesBase_TrackBallLabelTemplate).

## Adding Annotations
SfChart supports annotations, which enable you to mark specific areas of interest within the chart. In this example, we have added [text annotations](https://help.syncfusion.com/wpf/charts/annotations#text-annotation) to highlight specific context in the chart area.
